Hello! There can be many use cases for this app including: grocery list, todo list, organizer, etc.
Type something in the input field, then click the 'Add Todo'
You will see it appear with a checkbox which you can manually check(uncheck as well) in order to clear selected items.
Also, right click on the page to inspect element, and go to console to see these items logged!
Refreshing the page will not delete your items, it will maintain the state you had from before.
